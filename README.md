PROJECT BREAKDOWN: -
1. What parts were you in charge of?
   Joanne: Navigation bar
   
   Che Rui: Body content and carousel
   
   Valerie: Footer
   
3. Explain the feature you are most proud of. What techniques/methods you've used?
   Joanne: The search button. Applied animation with javascript
   
   Che Rui: The carousel, because it requires the implementation of javascript
   
   Valerie: Flexbox

4. Name one coding struggle and how you dealt with it.
   Joanne: Making sure the parent and child are organized, have to check and trial & error to make sure it gave the result that I wanted.

   Che Rui: Coding the 2-column layout for the tile content. To resolve that, I grouped tiles by rows and also set width values to align them to the left/right respectively.

   Valerie: Trying to arrange the different sections and making sure that they are in the correct position. It was the combination of trial and error, ChatGPT, and the Flexbox Froggy game.


5. Name one improvement you would like to work on.
   Joanne: Drop down feature, and also to find out whether there are other ways to make the coding neater or less repetitive.
   
   Che Rui: Responsive images and content
   
   Valerie: Media Query
